We have the following questions regarding the current  domain model:

* Are there any missing entities from the case description, that we have overlooked in the model?
* Is the Queue entity correctly, or should its relationships be changed ?
* Are there any redundant or incorrect relationships in our diagram that should be removed to simplify the architecture?
